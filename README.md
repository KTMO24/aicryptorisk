# AICryptoRisk

**AICryptoRisk** is an interactive, Python-based tool that integrates network risk simulation, idea expansion, and parameter optimization into one unified system. By combining scratch-built vector math, machine learning–inspired optimization, and integration with the Gemini generative language API, AICryptoRisk enables you to:

- **Simulate Network Risk Dynamics:**  
  Model a distributed system (e.g., a crypto network) using a 4D risk propagation model with external forcing. Visualize node-level risk changes and total network risk over time.

- **Expand Ideas into Detailed Business Models:**  
  Input an idea (for a product, service, campaign, etc.) and use Gemini to generate a detailed business model including timeline, system or campaign design, safety considerations, and profitability recommendations.

- **Optimize Simulation Parameters:**  
  Run a custom optimizer that uses finite differences (vector math) to adjust key simulation parameters (α, β, γ) so that the final total risk approaches a target safety threshold. Gemini then provides an explanation for the parameter adjustments.

- **Interactive GUI:**  
  Built with ipywidgets, the tool offers three main tabs for:
  - **Simulation**
  - **Idea Expansion**
  - **Optimization**

## Features

- **Flexible Input Methods:**  
  Provide simulation parameters via text input, file upload (plain text, Python script, or ZIP archive), or URL.

- **Network Simulation:**  
  - Builds a random connected network using NetworkX.
  - Initializes nodes with custom risk values and 4D attributes (region, tech, policy).
  - Simulates risk propagation using Euler integration with an external forcing function.

- **Visualization:**  
  - Animated visualization of node-level risk (color-coded) using Matplotlib.
  - Time series plot showing the evolution of total network risk against a safety threshold.

- **Idea Expansion:**  
  - Uses Gemini generative language API to expand an input idea into a comprehensive business model with timeline, system/tool design, and safety/profitability considerations.

- **Parameter Optimization:**  
  - A scratch-built, gradient-descent–inspired optimizer adjusts simulation parameters (α, β, γ) to meet a target risk threshold.
  - Provides Gemini-based natural-language explanations of parameter adjustments.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aicryptorisk.git
   cd aicryptorisk

	2.	Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install Dependencies:

pip install ipywidgets networkx matplotlib numpy requests


	4.	Enable ipywidgets (if needed):
For Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension

For JupyterLab, ensure you have the proper extension installed.

Usage
	1.	Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

jupyter notebook


	2.	Create a New Notebook:
Copy and paste the code from the repository (or use the provided Notebook file) into a cell and run the cell. This will launch the interactive GUI.
	3.	Using the Tabs:
	•	Simulation Tab:
	•	Enter your simulation parameters (or upload a file/enter a URL).
	•	Parameters include:
	•	alpha, beta, gamma – decay, diffusion, and external forcing scaling factors.
	•	U_max – maximum external forcing amplitude.
	•	safety_threshold – desired safety threshold for total network risk.
	•	num_nodes, dt, T – network size, simulation time step, and total simulation time.
	•	Click Run Simulation to view an animated visualization of network risk dynamics.
	•	Idea Expansion Tab:
	•	Enter your idea (e.g., “A decentralized crypto exchange with robust security and user incentives”).
	•	Click Expand Idea to generate a detailed business model including timeline, system/tool design, and safety/profitability considerations using Gemini.
	•	Optimization Tab:
	•	Provide simulation parameters as in the Simulation tab and set a target risk value.
	•	Click Optimize Parameters to run the optimizer, which adjusts parameters (α, β, γ) so that the final total risk approaches the target.
	•	Gemini provides a natural-language explanation for the parameter adjustments.

Configuration
	•	Gemini API Key:
Replace the placeholder "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" in the GeminiAI class with your actual Gemini API key.
	•	Optimization Settings:
The optimization routine uses a learning rate (default 0.05) and a fixed number of iterations (10). You can adjust these values in the optimize_parameters function as needed.
